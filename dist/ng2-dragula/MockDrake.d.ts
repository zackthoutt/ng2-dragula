 * The three methods that actually do anything are `on(event, listener)`,

 * events, and if you injected MockDrake properly with MockDrakeFactory or
 * mocked the DragulaService.find() method, then you can make ng2-dragula think
 * drags and drops are happening.
 *
 * Caveats:
 *
 * 1. YOU MUST MAKE THE DOM CHANGES YOURSELF.
 * 2. REPEAT: YOU MUST MAKE THE DOM CHANGES YOURSELF.
 *    That means `source.removeChild(el)`, and `target.insertBefore(el)`.
 * 3. None of the other methods do anything.
 *    That's ok, because ng2-dragula doesn't use them.
